# FakeNewsDetection
Misinformation classifier for general language content, especially speech claims and political content. We aim to use a Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) with attention to classify text as containing misinformation or not.


# Dataset
LIAR: LIAR is a publicly available dataset for fake news detection. A decade-long of +12.K manually labeled short statements were collected in various contexts from POLITIFACT.COM, which provides detailed analysis report and links to source documents for each case. This dataset can be used for fact-checking research as well. Notably, this new dataset is an order of magnitude larger than previously largest public fake news datasets of similar type. The LIAR dataset4 includes 12.8K human labeled short statements from POLITIFACT.COM’s API, and each statement is evaluated by a POLITIFACT.COM editor for its truthfulness.
